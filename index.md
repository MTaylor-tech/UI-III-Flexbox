[Back to Portfolio](https://majikpig.github.io)

### The Challenge
* To create a webpage from a design document using Flexbox (display: flex;).
* Refactor the home page layout with flexbox where `inline-block` was used before.
* Using the provided [design file](design-files/services-desktop-design.png), create the services page layout using flexbox and box model.

### Stretch Challenges

* Create another page based on one of the navigation items in addition to services.  Try to create a layout that follows the patterns of the first two designs but with your own creative twist.  Use lorem ipsum text for all your content.
* Introduce media queries into your services page to create a mobile view that stacks all the boxes on top of each other on phone but looks like the layout file on desktop.
